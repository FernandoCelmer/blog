## It's okay to say 'hello' without any subject

> **Ant√¥nioCandido** - 'Time is money', that's a monstrosity. Time is not money, time is the tissue of our life.

You don't necessarily need to have a very important topic or question to send a **'Hi, How are you?'** to a coworker on Slack or Discord. No one is so busy that they can't stop for 5 minutes to respond to **'Good Morning'**. Today we live in a tired society where everything is very fast and our time is considered money, but no, it's not like that, not everything is profit.

So give yourself at least a minute to wait and reply **'Good Morning!'**, it won't interfere with anything.

### Basic Tutorial:

- `9:34 Arthur Dent:` Hi Ford, how are you?
- `9:35 Ford Prefect:` Yes, everything is fine!
- `9:40 Arthur Dent:` Ok then :)

After that may come an interesting topic or an important question in your busy workday...
