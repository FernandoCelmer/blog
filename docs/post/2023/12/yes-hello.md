## It's okay to say 'hello' without any subject

> Time is not money. Time is the tissue of our life - **Ant√¥nioCandido**

You don't necessarily need to have a very important topic or question to send a **'Hi, How are you?'** to a coworker on Slack or Discord. No one is so busy that they can't stop for 5 minutes to respond to **'Good Morning'**. Today we live in a tired society where everything is very fast and our time is considered money, because no, it's not like that, not everything is profit.

So give yourself at least a minute to wait and reply 'Good Morning!', it doesn't change anything.

### Basic tutorial on how not to be a robot:

- `9:34 Arthur Dent:` Hi Arthur, how are you?
- `9:35 Ford Prefect:` Yes, everything is fine!
- `9:40 Arthur Dent:` Ok then :)

After that may come an interesting topic or an important question in your busy workday...
